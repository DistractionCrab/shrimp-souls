This project is currently discontinued as a full game project due to the current infeasibility of maintaining its operation. This has been made public for various reasons, including educational purposes for interacting with Twitch's API, Asynio, SSL usage and general backend development. 

Also contains a full Twitch Plugin that was hosted on Twitch at one point, and shows the general interaction between frontend and backend services.
